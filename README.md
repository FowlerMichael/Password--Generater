# Password--Generator
This is a simple password generator web application that generates a random password based on user preferences.

# Usage
To use the password generator, simply click the "Generate Password" button and follow the prompts. The application will ask you how many characters you want your password to be (between 8 and 128) and which types of characters you want to include (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters).

Once you have made your selections, the application will generate a random password for you, which will be displayed in the text area at the center of the page.
